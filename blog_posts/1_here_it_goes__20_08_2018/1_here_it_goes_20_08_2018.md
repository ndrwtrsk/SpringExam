# Here it goes

Since you came across this post, I'm assuming that like myself you're a well-learned man or woman and you wish to pass the `Spring Professional v5.0 Exam`. Also like myself you've noticed that there is a particular shortage of materials on the inter webs. Well, look no more for here I will document my own journey towards this goal. 

## Start with a why
Why would I want to be Spring Certified? For the Certificate itself? It has little value to me. For the fame and glory? No, not this either. For all the knowledge and experience that I will gather during the process of learning and becoming? Yes, that hits the spot. 

The process of answering those questions and solving tasks using the Spring 5.0 and the knowledge learned during it will be so much more valuable than anything. With those kind of tools, new perspectives on solving certain problems I will be able to developer better, faster, more confidently thus brining myself greater satisfaction as an engineer and as a consequence value to my employer and/or my client. 

## How? 
Simply.
1. Learn most of the stuff on my own from the interwebs and books.
2. Practice the theory and bang my head against the wall (hopefully!).
2. Source knowledge and opinions from my skilled and kind colleagues at work.
3. Pass the exam. The exam costs exactly $200 and once you decide to buy it, you will have 90 days to pass it.
4. And obviously document as I go for posterity. This is the whole point.

This is a self-learned way. You may go of course and purchase the Spring Course at [official Pivotal page](https://pivotal.io/training/certification).

## Essentials
To start off you need the most basic things:

### Official Documents
- Official page: [https://pivotal.io/training/certification](https://pivotal.io/training/certification)
- Exam purchase: [http://academy.pivotal.io/confirm-course?courseid=EDU-1120-APP](http://academy.pivotal.io/confirm-course?courseid=EDU-1120-APP)
- Spring 5.0 study guide (PDF): [https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/academy/Core-Spring-5.0-Certification-Study-Guide.pdf](https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/academy/Core-Spring-5.0-Certification-Study-Guide.pdf)
- Exam brief (PDF): [https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/training/exam-briefs/Pivotal_ExamBrief_SpringProfessional_5.pdf](https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/training/exam-briefs/Pivotal_ExamBrief_SpringProfessional_5.pdf)
- Training brief (PDF): [https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/training/training-briefs/Pivotal_EDU_CoreSpring_TrainingBrief.pdf](https://d1fto35gcfffzn.cloudfront.net/training/training-briefs/Pivotal_EDU_CoreSpring_TrainingBrief.pdf)

### Online guides
- Vojtech Ruzicka's guide for Spring Core cert. Highly recommend this one!:  [https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/exam-notes-pivotal-certified-spring-professional/](https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/exam-notes-pivotal-certified-spring-professional/)
- Here you will find Vojtech's study notes on GitHub. Again, I highly recommend this guy and his notes: [https://github.com/vojtechruz/spring-core-cert-notes-4.2](https://github.com/vojtechruz/spring-core-cert-notes-4.2)
- Vojtech's notes on Spring Web: [https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/pivotal-certified-spring-web-application-developer-notes/](https://www.vojtechruzicka.com/pivotal-certified-spring-web-application-developer-notes/)
- A purchase guide for the exam should you need one: [https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/how-to-purchase-spring-certification-voucher-online.html](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/how-to-purchase-spring-certification-voucher-online.html)

### Exam mocks
- [https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/how-to-purchase-spring-certification-voucher-online.html](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/01/how-to-purchase-spring-certification-voucher-online.html)
- [https://www.springmockexams.com](https://www.springmockexams.com)

Honestly, I wouldn't suggest using those mock exams solely to pass the exam. You should make sure you are attaining new knowledge not trying to pass the exam like you would do at the university.

### Books
I'm not including any links to any books just yet, as I don't even know if I will support myself with any books so far.


## Where do we go from here?
So that would be the end right now. Official Springw Study Guide offers a bunch of questions that I think I might answer in the posts that will follow, bit by bit, question by question, with explanations, code examples and some use cases. 

Stay tuned and stay curious.
